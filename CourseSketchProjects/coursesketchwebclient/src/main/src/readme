This is all of the src code for the website it is separated into different utilities.

common:     Common is where you put items used for students and instructors but for specific pages.  EX: problemNavigation
            Or another example is the lecture selection which should be the same for students and instructors.

student:    Where you put all code that is specific to just the student
instructor: Where you put all code that is specific to just the instructor
sketching:  Where all of the code for sketching goes (sketch surface, graphics, libraries, recognition)
utilities:  this is where you put code that is not really specific to a single page but is relevant to multiple pages.
            Inside Utilites:
                connection:     Where the code that connects to the server (and protobuf code) goes
                functions:      Just some snippets of potentially useful functions
                persistantData: Database code for our local database
                templates:      Html5 custom elements that can be used on any page it is needed
                libraries:      Libraries that we use in course sketch (text to speech, jquery, interact, ...)


And that is the main grouping of the folders as of right now.
We try to use as little code as possible and to reuse as much code as possible.
With as little effort on the developer as possible.


Thanks for reading!
Good luck programing!
