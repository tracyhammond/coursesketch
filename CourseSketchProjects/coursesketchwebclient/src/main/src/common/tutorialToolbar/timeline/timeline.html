	<div class="tutorialtutorial">Hello! This is an interface used for creating tutorials on how to use various elements of the CourseSketch website. Clicking the '+' button below reveals a toolbar with three simple tools that can be used to guide the user through a series of steps. The 'T' tool button creates an editable, draggable text box that can be used to explain the specifics of a particular step. The 'tts' tool button similarly creates a text box capable of reading the text aloud to the user. The 'H' tool button allows you to highlight a portion of text on the screen with any chosen color. Once you've created a step with the aforementioned tools, the 'Add step' button can create the next step in the tutorial.</div>
